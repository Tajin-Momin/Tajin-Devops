Q. What is Devops ?
Ans - Devops is like bridge between software development and IT operations.
  its all about making the process of building , testing nd deploying software faster , more reliable and more efficient
  by fostering collaboration and automation between development and operation teams.

Q. What is Devops Life Cycle ?
Ans -  The Devops lifecycle consists of several stages that span the entire software development process , from planning and coding to deployement and monitoring
    hence are the key stages 
    1] plan : in this stage team define the goals , requirement and scope of the project. 
        They also prioritize task and plan the development and deployement process .
    2] Code : Developers write and review code according to project requirements. Version control systems like Git are often 
         used to manage code changes and collabrotion among team members .
    3] Build : The stage involves compiling , building and packaging the code into executable articraft. Automated build tools and continuous integration 
        ( CI) pipeline help streamline the process and ensure that code changes are integrated and tested frequently.
    4] Test : Quality Assurance (QA) engineers conduct various tests including unit test , integration test, and acceptance test, to verify 
         that the software meets quality standards and functions as expected.
    5] Deploy: Once the code passes all tests, it's deployed to production or staging environments.
        Continuous Delivery ( CD) pipeline automate the deployment process, making it faster, more reliable, and less error-Prone.
    6] Operate : in  ths stage , the software is monitored and maintained in production environments.
           Operation team manage infrastructure, handle incident, and ensure the availability,performance and security of the application.
    7] Monitor: Continuously gather data on the performance , usages and reliability of the software.
        analyze monitoring metrics, and logs to identify trends, anomalies, and area for optimization.
        Use monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana ,or ELK stack to visualize and analyze monitoring data 
        collect feedback from users and stakeholders to inform future iteration and improvements 


Q . What is a service ?
Ans : In Devops, a service referce to a component or functionality provided by an application or system that delivers value to user or 
other component within the software ecosystem .
A service could be anything  from web application , a database , an API or MICRO SERVICE , Each service typically has its own database ,
dependencies and infrastructure requirements.

Q. What is Monolithic Architecture and Micro services?
ANS : Monolithic Architecture is like a Big , single , all-in-one apllicaton where all different parts are tightly connected and run
 together , kind of like a huge building with everything inside it.
 MICRISERVICES , on the other hand , break down the application into smaller , independent services that can run separately.
Each service handles a specific function or feature , like different shops in mall . They communicate with each other to get things done , 
but they can also work on their own .

** GIT ** 
- IT is a Command line Tool ( Open Source )
- In CI/CD the main Component is Git
- Git is a Version Control System which is used to keep track and monitor changes made in our code 
- it is also revert the changes to previous version 
- It was created by linus Torvalds 

Usases Of Git 
- Manage Project With Repositories
- Clone a project to work on local machines or copy
- control and track changes with staging and commiting 
- Branch and Merge to allow for work on different parts and Version of project 
- Pull the latest Version of project to a local copy
- Push local updates to the main project 



** GITHUB **
GITHUB is a Developer Platform that allows developers to Create, Store , Manage and share their code
- it uses GIT software ,providing the Distributed Version Control of GIT 
- It is Commonly used to Host open source software development project
